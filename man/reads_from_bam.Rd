\usage{
reads_from_bam(
  file_path,
  genomic_ranges,
  add_tags = c("CR", "CB", "CY", "AS", "UR", "UY", "HI", "NH", "nM", "RE"),
  read_scores = T,
  revcomp_minus_strand = F,
  revcomp_plus_strand = F,
  lapply_fun = lapply,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{path to a position-sorted bam file; index file (.bai) has to be in the same directory}

\item{genomic_ranges}{GRanges object with n genomic ranges. Setting the strand information to + or - does
not influence the reads returned by this function.}

\item{add_tags}{tags to extract from bam file, passed to Rsamtools::ScanBamParam(); character(0) for nothing; missing tags do not seem to matter}

\item{read_scores}{calculate read scores from PhredQuality}

\item{revcomp_minus_strand}{passed as reverseComplement to Rsamtools::ScanBamParam. If FALSE, then all reads
are returned as if they mapped to the plus strand (which is the convention for BAM files). Having all reads projected
to the plus strand may be useful for subsequent alignment of reads to a reference sequence (e.g. a gene) from the plus strand (e.g. HLA-A).}

\item{revcomp_plus_strand}{If TRUE then all reads mapped to minus strand are projected to the plus strand:
seq is reverseComplemented and qual is reversed.
Useful for subsequent alignment of reads to a reference sequence (e.g. a gene) from the minus strand (e.g. HLA-B or -C).}

\item{lapply_fun}{lapply function name without quotes; lapply, pbapply::pblapply or parallel::mclapply are suggested}

\item{...}{additional argument to the lapply function; mainly mc.cores when parallel::mclapply is chosen}
}
\value{
a data frame of reads
}
\description{
This is basically a wrapper around Rsamtools::ScanBamParam and Rsamtools::scanBam. The output from scanBam is processed to a data frame and additional columns
are attached. Providing an exact range has been found to not always work as expected. E.g. there were reads in chr6 outside the exonic regions of HLA-A
that could be mapped to HLA-A. This may be an individual problem of the underlying BAM file (mapping). In order to not miss any relevant reads, one may pass
a wider genomic range for reads to return (e.g. whole chr6 if HLA loci are of interest, see example). When the purpose is to align
reads to a gene from the plus strand (e.g. HLA-A), set revcomp_minus_strand and revcomp_plus_strand to FALSE. For a gene
from the minus strand, set both to TRUE.
