\description{
This is a combination of join functions and the coalesce function from dplyr.
It is a convenient way to solve the generic task of updating a data frame (replacing NAs)
with another one that holds additional information. In its current form the information (non-NA)
in the left-hand data frame (x) will be prioritized over that information in the right-hand
data frame (y).
