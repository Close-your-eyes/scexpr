\title{Prepare a data frame from a xml file containing hla allele information}
\usage{
hla_df_from_xml(file_path, lapply_fun = lapply, replace_none_pg = T, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{path to the xml file, may be in zipped format}

\item{lapply_fun}{function name without quotes; lapply, pbapply::pblapply or parallel::mclapply are suggested}

\item{replace_none_pg}{replace "None" in p_group and g_group with allele_protein and allele_coding, respectively}

\item{...}{additional argument to the lapply function; e.g. mc.cores may be passed when parallel::mclapply is chosen above}
}
\value{
a data frame
}
\description{
The xml file required for this function may be downloaded from the GitHub repository of the IMGT/HLA organization:
https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA/blob/Latest/xml/hla.xml.zip. The function then creates a dataframe from this xml
which can be used subsequently to match reads of HLA-loci from bulk or single cell RNA seq. By default the sequence
of the 2nd + 3rd exon are returned in an extra column as these will most likely be used to infer the HLA type in case of MHC-I.
